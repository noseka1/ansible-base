    # Registry image pull Queries Per Second. Set to no limit to avoid pull QPS exceeded on cluster reboot.

    # Two parameters control the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled to a node: podsPerCore and maxPods.
    # If you use both options, the lower of the two limits the number of pods on a node.
    #

    #
    # The maxPods parameter sets the number of pods the node can run to a fixed value, regardless of the properties of the node.
    # Set maxPods field to increase the maximum number of pods that can be placed on a single node. The default maximum is 250.
    # When using large cluster nodes, this default maximum can be easily exceeded.
    maxPods: 500
    # The podsPerCore parameter sets the number of pods the node can run based on the number of processor cores on the node.
    # For example, if podsPerCore is set to 10 on a node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the
    # node will be 40.
    # Setting podsPerCore to 0 (which is the default) disables this limit:
    podsPerCore: 0
