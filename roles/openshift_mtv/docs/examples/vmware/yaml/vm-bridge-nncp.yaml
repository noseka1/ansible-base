    # Create a vm-bridge.131 VLAN port for testing network connectivity.
    # This port won't work right away. To make this bridge port work,
    # it is required to issue the following command on the OpenShift node:
    # $ bridge vlan add vid 131 dev vm-bridge self
    # After running the command, check that the VLAN 131 filter was added to the bridge:
    # $ bridge vlan
    # port              vlan-id
    # vm-bridge         1 PVID Egress Untagged
    #                   131

    # $ ping 10.85.0.99
