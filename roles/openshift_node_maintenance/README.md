# Node Maintenance Operator

The node maintenance operator achieves the same results as the oc adm cordon and oc adm drain commands, however, the Node Maintenance Operator offers a declarative approach to switch a node to maintenance by using a custom resource. When such a resource exists (NodeMaintenance) for a node, the Operator cordons and drains the node until the resource is deleted.

For example, to put node master1.mycluster5.example.com into maintenance mode, apply the following resource:

```
apiVersion: nodemaintenance.medik8s.io/v1beta1
kind: NodeMaintenance
metadata:
  name: master1
spec:
  nodeName: master1.mycluster5.example.com
  reason: NIC replacement
```
