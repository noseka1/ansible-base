# Choose one of the resource profiles:
# 1. Lean mode: Minimizes resource consumption by allocating fewer CPUs and less memory for resource-efficient operations.
# 2. Balanced mode (default): Optimized for right amount of CPU and memory resources to support diverse workloads.
# 3. Performance mode: Tailored for high-performance, allocating ample CPUs and memory to ensure optimal execution of demanding workloads.
