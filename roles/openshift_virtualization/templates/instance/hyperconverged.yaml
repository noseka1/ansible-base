spec:
  # By default, live migration of virtual machines between nodes with differing CPU models is not possible. To allow live-migrating between nodes
  # with different CPUs, you can set the defaultCPUModel to a common model supported by all cluster nodes. Check the cpu-feature.node.kubevirt.io
  # labels on the Node object to find out which CPU models are supported by a specific node. Following the modification of the default CPU model,
  # it is necessary to restart the virtual machines in order for them to adapt the new CPU model.
  #defaultCPUModel: Skylake-Server-noTSX-IBRS
  # Migrate the VM on eviction if live migration is possible, otherwise directly evict

    # LiveMigrate workload update method:
    # VMIs that support live migration are migrated during the update process. The VM guest moves into a new pod with the updated components enabled.
    # VMIs that do not support live migration are not disrupted or updated.
    # If a VMI has the LiveMigrate eviction strategy but does not support live migration, it is not updated.
