    # LiveMigrate workload update method:
    # VMIs that support live migration are migrated during the update process. The VM guest moves into a new pod with the updated components enabled.
    # VMIs that do not support live migration are not disrupted or updated.
    # If a VMI has the LiveMigrate eviction strategy but does not support live migration, it is not updated.
